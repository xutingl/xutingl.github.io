I'm a fourth year undergraduate student in UC Berkeley double majoring in Computer Science and Operations Research, advised by [Rakesh Verma](http://cs.uh.edu/~rmverma/) and [Joseph Gonzalez](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/).

I'm interested in areas around distributed systems and database. I'm seeking a PhD student position in Fall 2023. Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jSAHMol5t-h_BSJtyR8Xh-U2pe0HEETm/view?usp=sharing).
