I'm a Ph.D. student at UPenn's [Distributed Systems Lab](https://dsl.cis.upenn.edu/) advised by [Vincent Liu](https://vincen.tl/). I'm broadly interested in networks and Machine Learning systems.

Before joining UPenn, I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Operations Research at UC Berkeley, where I was part of the Sky Lab (formerly RISELab). I was advised by [Joseph Gonzalez](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/) and [Paras Jain](https://www.parasjain.com/) at the Sky Lab and [Rakesh Verma](http://cs.uh.edu/~rmverma/) at UH.
