## Undergraduate Researcher | ReDAS Lab, University of Houston
_06/2021 - Present_

Research focus: Deception Detection, NLP; Mentor: [Dr. Rakesh Verma](http://cs.uh.edu/~rmverma/)

- Implemented and experimented with various feature engineering algorithms, ML and DL models in NLP.

- Compiled a cross-domain deception dataset with fake reviews, fake opinions, phishing emails, and fake news.

- Trained BERT models on the cross-domain dataset to show the possibility of domain-independent deception detection with results published in [CODASPY 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3508398.3519358).
